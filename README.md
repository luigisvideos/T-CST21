This repository contains supplementary material of the paper:
# F. Basile, L. Ferrara, *Validation of industrial automation systems using a timed model of system requirements*, IEEE Transactions on Control System Technologies, 2021

The paper focuses on the validation of industrial automation systems using a timed discrete event model, precisely a Time Interepret Petri Net model, of system specifications.
 
 We think that its reeding is improved by the provided supplementary materials.

 In particular, the following materials are contained in the repo:
 1) The extended version of the figures associated to the eMSCG, pMSCG and 
    expanded pMSCG discussed in the Examples.
 2) The textual log of the system evolution validated in the Examples; additionally,
	the associated sequence of transition firings is provided also.
 3) A video describing the experimental set-up for the on-line procedure is [available here](https://youtu.be/fht8cH_XqTc)
