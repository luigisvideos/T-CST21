The paper focused on validation of industrial automation systems using a timed discrete event model of system specifications.
 
 We think that its reeding is improved by the provided supplementary materials.

 In particular, we attach in the folder the following materials:
 1) The extended version of the figures associated to the eMSCG, pMSCG and 
    expanded pMSCG discussed in the Examples.
 2) The textual log of the system evolution validated in the Examples; additionally,
	the associated sequence of transition firings is provided also.
 3) A video describing the experimental set-up for the on-line procedure.
